 * This class is responsible for creating an instance of a game while connecting and passing calls to {@link #nextMove()}
 * and {@link #moveMadeByOpponent(BoardCell)} from the {@link RestService}.
 * <p>
 * ATTENTION: The application must be rebooted to play a new game each time (also another instance of the application
 * can be started on another port). Unfortunately this is the best way to implement this without a database and
 * by adding a database the task would be much more difficult to implement. Now YOU - the programmers - can hold
 * all data inside the GamePlayer object without worrying about losing them after REST-Service call is finished
 * because of the lack of the database.
